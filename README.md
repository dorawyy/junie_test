# BiteSwipe

BiteSwipe is an Android app designed to simplify the process of choosing a restaurant for groups of friends.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Android application written in Kotlin
- `/back-end` - Node.js backend written in TypeScript

## Description

BiteSwipe addresses the common problem of deciding where to eat with a group. Using a Tinder-like swiping interface, users can quickly browse restaurants, swipe right on places they like, and left on places they don't. Once all members of the group have swiped, BiteSwipe matches the group with the most mutually liked restaurant and provides details like location, menu, and reviews.

## Main Features

1. **Swipe Restaurants**: Users swipe through restaurant options individually, indicating their preferences.
2. **Group Session**: Users create or join a group session, and BiteSwipe compiles everyone's preferences.
3. **Restaurant Match Results**: After all members have completed their swipes, the app displays the matched restaurant with details.

## Target Audience

Groups of friends, families, and coworkers who frequently struggle with choosing a place to eat.
